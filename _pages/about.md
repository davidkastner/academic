Over seventy years ago in a series of inquisitive lectures, Erwin Schrödinger posed an unusual question to the physics community. ‘What is Life?’ His visionary lectures broke the complexities of life into mechanistic systems that could be explained using modern physics. As a biophysical chemist, I believe Schrödinger’s question elegantly captures the beauty and inspiration behind this multidisciplinary and dynamic field and will help answer the question, ‘What is life?’

Research Interests
======
My formal education is in biophysics, and my research projects span a diversity of fields: synthetic organic chemistry, mammalian tissue models, quantum chemistry calculations, protein engineering, bioinformatics, etc. I studied organic chemistry under Dr. Steven Castle, protein NMR with Dr. Haribabu Arthanari at Dana Farber/Harvard Cancer Center, and protein dynamics with Dr. Nico Tjandra at the NIH. After graduating, I worked as a full-time scientist at the Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) under Dr. Trudy Oliver studying small cell lung cancer via genetically engineered mouse models. I am currently a PhD student at MIT studying high-valent enzymes under the mentorship of Dr. Heather Kulik.
